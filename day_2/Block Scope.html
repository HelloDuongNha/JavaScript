Block Scope
Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript did not have Block Scope.

JavaScript had Global Scope and Function Scope.

ES6 introduced the two new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

These two keywords provided Block Scope in JavaScript:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<body>
    <script>

        {
            let x = 2; // x can NOT be used here
        }
        "Global Scope:"
        // Variables declared with the var always have Global Scope.
        // Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope:
        {
            var x = 2; // x CAN be used here
        }

        "Cannot be Redeclared"
        // Variables defined with let can not be redeclared.

        // You can not accidentally redeclare a variable declared with let.
        let x = "John Doe";
        let x = 0;

        "Can be Redeclared"
        // Variables defined with var can be redeclared.
        // With var you can do this:
        var x = "John Doe";
        var x = 0;
    </script>

</body>

</html>
