The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:
Fixed values
Variable values

When to Use var, let, or const?
1. Always declare variables
2. Always use const if the value should not be changed
3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)
4. Only use let if you can't use const
5. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers.


One Statement, Many Variables
You can declare many variables in one statement.
Start the statement with let and separate the variables by comma:

Example
let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;
